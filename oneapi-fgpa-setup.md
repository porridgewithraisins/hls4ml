# Setting up intel oneapi with fpga addon

```bash
yay -S intel-oneapi-basekit
curl https://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/IRC_NAS/ff129224-aa19-48f7-96d4-ad12d2d427f9/intel-fpga-support-for-compiler-2025.0.0.591_offline.sh | sh
```
it opens a GUI installer just yes-yes-yes through it.

That's all needed.
